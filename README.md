### Hi, I'm Chase! üßë‚Äçüíª



#### A little about me

I am a Phoenix, Arizona native who loves to code! I've earned a master's degree in Engineering Management and bachelor's degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Computational Mathematical Sciences. I'm also [PSMI certified](https://www.scrum.org/user/512015/). I've worked for multiple software companies as a full-stack engineer and founded a software startup, Lieuu, which is in the real estate space. I have extensive experience in distributed, scalable, and secure software architectures, typically built with React/NextJS, NodeJS, and MongoDB. I am currently a Software Consultant/Principal at Valure LLC and always looking for new and exciting projects to engage on!
