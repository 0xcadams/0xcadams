### Hello there!

I am a Phoenix, Arizona native who loves software - I've earned a master's degree in Engineering Management and bachelor's degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Computational Mathematical Sciences. I'm also [PSMI certified](https://www.scrum.org/user/512015/). I've worked for multiple software companies as a full-stack engineer and founded a software startup, [Lieuu](https://lieuu.com/), in the real estate space. I also lead software teams working on moonshot projects at [The Luminosity Lab](https://theluminositylab.com/) at Arizona State University.

I have extensive experience in distributed, scalable, and secure software architectures, with technologies including React/NextJS, Elixir, NodeJS, and PostgreSQL. I am always looking for new and exciting projects to engage on!
